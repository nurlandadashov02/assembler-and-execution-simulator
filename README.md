# assembler-and-execution-simulator
The given problem requires us to implement an assembler and an execution simulator for a hypothetical CPU called CPU230. One of the main purposes is to read the assembly code and produce an assembled binary output in “prog.bin” file, where each line is a 24-bit instruction. The first 6 bits represent an operation code, next 2 bits represent an addressing mode, and the last 16 bits represent an operand. After obtaining the assembled binary file, the output of the program should be printed by executing each instruction in the “.bin” file. Both programs are written in Python.
